# uOttawa Timetable Planner

This application makes it easier for university students to create their timetables. Simply specify what courses you need to take along with any constraints (gaps, days off, etc.) and the app will generate all the possible timetables matching those criteria. You can then see all the generated timetables including the times, sections, professors and locations of each of the courses. Once you pick you favourite, you can use it to register for you courses using Rabaska or save it for later.
